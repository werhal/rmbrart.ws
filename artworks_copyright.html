    <h2>Copyright Information</h2> <p>

<p>Some artworks included in this application are <b>protected by copyright</b>.</p>

<p>We are making such material available in our efforts to form an integral view of the world art for the user, attract his or her interest to the authors of the presented artworks.</p>

<p>Because the images are works of art, the entire images are needed to identify the artworks, properly convey the subject and meaning intended by the artists, and avoid misrepresenting the artworks.</p>

<p>We believe this constitutes a <b>FAIR USE</b> of any such copyrighted material as provided for in section 107 of the US Copyright Law.</p>

<p>Fair use rationale:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The application consists mainly of its own algorithms and game logic. It uses artworks to give a whole new reason for their appearance on the screen. This makes the application a <b>transformative work</b>.</li>
  <li><b>The images are readily and freely available on the internet</b> on such sites as <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/">WikiArt</a>, 
  <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/">Google Arts & Culture</a>, <a href="https://www.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia</a>. We may bring additional attention to the artworks, but not provide the viewer with copyrighted material he or she does not already have.</li>
  <li><b>The purposes for including the artworks in the game are purely educational</b>. We can benefit from recognizing 
  significant works as significant, including them in the app and thus making the educational component of the game better. 
  But <b>we are not making profits from the artworks</b> themselves.</li>
  <li><b>We do not compete with copyright holders</b>. Since the digital images are unsuitable as a replacement for the original works neither aesthetically or commercially, their use in the game can increase the incomes of the copyright holders, but in no way diminish them.</li>
</ul>
