    <h1>Copyright Information</h1> 
   
<p>Werhal Media built the Rmbr Artworks app as an educational game. Some images included in the app depict <b>works of art that are protected by copyright</b>.</p>

<p>We are making such material available in our efforts to form an integral view of the world art for the user, attract his or her interest to the authors of the presented artworks.</p>

<p>Because the images depict works of art, the entire images are needed to identify the original artworks, properly convey 
  the subject and meaning intended by the artists, and avoid misrepresenting the artworks.</p>

<p>We believe this constitutes a <b>FAIR USE</b> of any such copyrighted material as provided for in section 107 of the US Copyright Law.</p>

<p>Fair use rationale:</p>

<ul>

  <li class="p">
    All the used images are readily and freely <b>available on the internet</b> on such sites as 
    <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/">WikiArt</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/">Google Arts & Culture</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia</a> and others. We may bring additional attention to the artworks, but we do not 
    provide the user with copyrighted material he or she does not already have.
  </li>

  <li class="p">
    The purposes for including the images in the app are  <b>purely educational</b>. The only benefit that we get from 
    having some copyrighted works in the collection is that the user may acquire a more complete knowledge about the 
    arts. We are <b>not making profits</b> from the artworks themselves and not using their titles or artist names 
    for app promotion.
  </li>    

  <li class="p">
    Digital images displayed on the phone screen are <b>unsuitable as a replacement</b> for the original works drawn 
    on canvas neither aesthetically or commercially.
  </li>

  <li class="p">
    The depiction of the copyrighted artworks in the educational app, referring to authors each time they are displayed, 
    <b>can only increase the incomes of the copyright holders</b>, but in no way diminish them.
  </li>

  <li class="p">
    The app is a <b>transformative work</b> giving the used images a whole new reason for their appearance on the 
    screen. In addition to the copyrighted images, the app consists of its own algorithms and game logic, as well as 
    a huge collection of public domain imagery.
  </li>



</ul>
