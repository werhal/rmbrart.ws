    <h1>Copyright Information</h1> 
   
<p>Werhal Media built the <b>Rmbr Artworks</b> app as an <b>educational quiz game</b>. Some images included in the app depict works of art that are protected by copyright.</p>

<p>We are making such material available in our efforts to form an integral view of the world art for the user, attract his or her interest to the authors of the presented artworks.</p>

<p>Because the images depict works of art, the entire images are needed to identify the original artworks, properly convey 
  the subject and meaning intended by the artists, and avoid misrepresenting the artworks.</p>

<p>We believe this constitutes a <b>FAIR USE</b> of any such copyrighted material as provided for in section 107 of the US Copyright Law.</p>

<p>Fair use rationale:</p>

<ul>

  <li class="p">
    All the used images are <b>readily and freely available on the internet</b> on such sites as 
    <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/">WikiArt</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/">Google Arts & Culture</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia</a>. We do not provide the user with copyrighted material 
    he or she does not already have.
  </li>

  <li class="p">
    Images are used only to <b>inform the user about the appearance of the works</b> and to indicate the creators of these 
    works. As a result, the user may acquire a more complete knowledge about the arts.
  </li>    

  <li class="p">
    Digital images displayed on the phone screen are <b>unsuitable as a replacement for the original works</b> drawn 
    on canvas neither aesthetically or commercially.
  </li>

  <li class="p">
    The way images used <b>can only increase the incomes of the copyright holders</b>, but in no way diminish them.
  </li>

  <li class="p">
    The <b>app is a transformative work</b> adding to copyrighted material its own algorithms and game logic, uniquely 
    mixing images of copyrighted artworks with a huge collection of copyright-free public domain imagery.
  </li>

</ul>
