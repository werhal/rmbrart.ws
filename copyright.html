    <h1>Copyright Information</h1> 
    <p>

<p>Some artworks included in this application are <b>protected by copyright</b>.</p>

<p>We are making such material available in our efforts to form an integral view of the world art for the user, attract his or her interest to the authors of the presented artworks.</p>

<p>Because the images are works of art, the entire images are needed to identify the artworks, properly convey the subject and meaning intended by the artists, and avoid misrepresenting the artworks.</p>

<p>We believe this constitutes a <b>FAIR USE</b> of any such copyrighted material as provided for in section 107 of the US Copyright Law.</p>

<p>Fair use rationale:</p>

<ul>

  <li class="p">
    <b>The application is a transformative work</b> giving the used images a whole new reason for their appearance on the screen. 
    In addition to the copyrighted images, the application consists of its own algorithms and game logic, as well as 
    a huge collection of copyright-free public domain imagery.
  </li>

  <li class="p">
    <b>All the used copyrighted images are readily and freely available on the internet</b> on such sites as 
    <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/">WikiArt</a>, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/">Google Arts & Culture</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia</a> and others. We may bring additional attention to the artworks, but we do not 
    provide the viewer with copyrighted material he or she does not already have.
  </li>

  <li class="p">
    <b>The purposes for including the artworks in the game are purely educational</b>. The only benefit that we get from 
    having some significant copyrighted works in the collection is that the player may acquire a more 
    complete knowledge about the arts. <b>We are not making profits from the artworks</b> themselves and not using their 
    titles or artist names for application promotion.
  </li>    




  

  <li class="p">

    <b>We do not compete with copyright holders</b>. Digital images temporary displayed on the phone screen are unsuitable as 
    a replacement for the original works neither aesthetically or commercially. Therefore, <b>the use of the copyrighted 
    material in the game</b>, referring to authors each time it is displayed, <b>can only increase the incomes of the copyright holders</b>, 
    but in no way diminish them.

  </li>
</ul>
